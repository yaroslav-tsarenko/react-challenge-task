# React Test Project

Welcome to the **React Test Project**! This project is built with modern web technologies to demonstrate how to integrate state-of-the-art tools and libraries into a React application.

## 🛠️ Stack

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to improve code quality and developer experience.
- **TanStack Router**: A powerful routing library for managing navigation and application state in React.
- **RxJS**: A library for reactive programming using observables, making asynchronous events easier to work with.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development and styling.
- **Vite**: A fast and lightweight build tool that optimizes your development experience.
- **Vitest**: A fast testing framework built for Vite and designed for modern JavaScript and TypeScript projects.

## 🚀 Features

- **Efficient Routing** with TanStack Router.
- **Reactive Programming** with RxJS for managing async data streams.
- **Type Safety** ensured with TypeScript for more reliable and maintainable code.
- **Beautiful UI** with Tailwind CSS for rapid styling.
- **Modern Testing** powered by Vitest for writing unit and integration tests.
